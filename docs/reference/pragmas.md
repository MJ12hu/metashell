# The pragmas Metashell provides

Metashell provides a number of pragmas controlling the shell. Note that these
pragmas are available only from the shell's command prompt. If you put them in a
header file and include that header, these pragmas will be ignored.
The pragmas accepted by Metashell begin with `#pragma metashell`. Since this is
a long prefix to type, Metashell accepts shorter versions as well. Here is the
complete list of accepted forms. All of them are equivalent:

* `#pragma metashell`
* `#pragma msh`
* `#metashell`
* `#msh`

Metashell supports the following pragmas:

* __`#msh environment`__ <br />

* __`#msh environment push`__ <br />
Pushes the current environment to the environment stack.

* __`#msh environment reload`__ <br />
Re-reads the included header files from disc.

* __`#msh environment reset`__ <br />
Resets the environment to its initial state. It does not change the environment stack.

* __`#msh environment save <path>`__ <br />
Saves the environment into a file. This is disabled by default. It can be enabled using the --enable_saving command line argument.

* __`#msh environment stack`__ <br />
Displays the size of the environment stack.

* __`#msh evaluate <code>`__ <br />

* __`#msh help [<command>]`__ <br />
Displays a help message.

* __`#msh included headers [<expression>]`__ <br />
Displays the list of header files (recursively) included into the environment. When <expression> is provided, it displays the headers added to the envrionment by <expression>.

Displays the names of the defined macros

* __`#msh macros`__ <br />
Displays the macro definitions

* __`#msh mdb [-full] [<type>]`__ <br />

* __`#msh pp <exp>`__ <br />
Displays the preprocessed expression.

* __`#msh precompiled_headers [on|1|off|0]`__ <br />
Turns precompiled header usage on or off. When no arguments are used, it displays if precompiled header usage is turned on.

* __`#msh preprocessed echo [on|1|off|0]`__ <br />
Turns display preprocessed commands on or off. When no arguments are used, it displays if display preprocessed commands is turned on.

* __`#msh preprocessor mode`__ <br />
Set Metashell to preprocessor mode

* __`#msh quit`__ <br />
Terminates the shell.

* __`#msh quoteincludes`__ <br />
